But the 01-0150-415 is a distinctly 70s creation, where you get the feeling they just wanted to do everything.

There was no precedent. Total failure was an option, and fail it did. The 01-0150-415 only sold from 1972 to 1975 before folding. It likely made Zenith very little to no profit. But it succeeded in making the watch world a more interesting place. I only highlight this philosophy as Zenith, in particular, seem so fond of a reissue. <\/p><p>They do it well, there’s no arguing. But as Peter Thiel once spoke of the great innovators, ‘In many ways, if you’re copying them, you’re not really learning from them.’ The argument here is that great innovation happens only once, but the road to that singularity is paved with many failures. For one, I celebrate the eccentric and esoteric failures that were willing to think totally independently and take that risk.<\/p><p><em>Words courtesy of Hairspring.com<\/em><\/p>","add_icons":false,"text_size":"medium","first_button_label":"","first_button_link":"","first_button_outline_style":false,"second_button_label":"","second_button_link":"","second_button_outline_style":true}}},"block_order":["media-with-text-1","media-with-text-2","db95f5fc-be15-4b17-89ce-cecca9eb04e6"],"settings":{"layout":"fixed","height":"medium","stack_blocks":true,"center_tabs":false,"padding_top":1,"padding_bottom":1,"color_scheme":"default-with-accent-1","custom_colors":true,"color_foreground":"#000000","color_accent":"#c99952","color_background":"#ffffff","color_gradient":""}},"product-recommendations":{"type":"product-recommendations","disabled":true,"settings":{"layout":"full","limit":4,"slider_large":true,"slider_mobile":true,"padding_top":1,"padding_bottom":1,"center_text":false,"title":"You may also like","image_container_ratio":"square","fit_image_to_container":false,"image_padding":5,"enable_second_image_on_hover":true,"color_scheme":"accent-1","custom_colors":true,"color_foreground":"#000000","color_accent":"#c99952","color_background":"#ffffff","color_gradient":"linear-gradient(310deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 1) 15%, rgba(247, 238, 229, 1) 85%)"}},"recently-viewed-products":{"type":"recently-viewed-products","disabled":true,"settings":{"style":"non-collapsible","enable_quick_view":false,"enable_clear_history":true,"color_scheme":"default","custom_colors":true,"color_foreground":"#000000","color_background":"#ffffff"}},"309586a0-fb54-4d80-9bf5-3beb12302dc8":{"type":"rich-text","blocks":{"template--17440688668978__309586a0-fb54-4d80-9bf5-3beb12302dc8-16729316993005526b-0":{"type":"icon","settings":{"icon":"icon-email","reveal":false}},"template--17440688668978__309586a0-fb54-4d80-9bf5-3beb12302dc8-16729316993005526b-1":{"type":"heading","settings":{"title":"Get in touch to discover more","size":"h1"}},"template--17440688668978__309586a0-fb54-4d80-9bf5-3beb12302dc8-16729316993005526b-2":{"type":"text","settings":{"text":"<p>If you have any questions about vintage watches, or about a particular watch in our collection, we''re happy to answer them.<\/p>","style":"text"}},"template--17440688668978__309586a0-fb54-4d80-9bf5-3beb12302dc8-16729316993005526b-3":{"type":"buttons","settings":{"first_button_label":"CONTACT US","first_button_link":"","first_button_style":false,"second_button_label":"","second_button_link":"","second_button_style":true}}},"block_order":["template--17440688668978__309586a0-fb54-4d80-9bf5-3beb12302dc8-16729316993005526b-0","template--17440688668978__309586a0-fb54-4d80-9bf5-3beb12302dc8-16729316993005526b-1","template--17440688668978__309586a0-fb54-4d80-9bf5-3beb12302dc8-16729316993005526b-2","template--17440688668978__309586a0-fb54-4d80-9bf5-3beb12302dc8-16729316993005526b-3"],"settings":{"full_width":true,"text_position":"center center","overlay":30,"image_height_large":"small","image_height_mobile":"medium","enable_parallax":true,"padding_top":1,"padding_bottom":1,"soft_background":false,"color_scheme":"default-with-accent-1","custom_colors":true,"color_foreground":"#061c2f","color_accent":"#c99952","color_background":"#f7eee5","color_gradient":""}},"16ec8717-27f7-4847-8742-57fcbfbd75d7":{"type":"newsletter","settings":{"layout":"full","padding_top":1,"padding_bottom":1,"center_text":false,"icon":"icon-email","title":"","text":"<p>News and promotions straight to your mailbox.<\/p>","form_subtext":"Unsubscribe easily, whenever you like.","text_size":"medium","image_height_large":"small","image_height_mobile":"medium","text_position_large":"left","text_position_mobile":"top","enable_parallax":false,"color_scheme":"default-with-accent-1","custom_colors":true,"color_foreground":"#ffffff","color_accent":"#c99952","color_background":"#000000","color_gradient":""}}},"order":["main","media-with-text","product-recommendations","recently-viewed-products","309586a0-fb54-4d80-9bf5-3beb12302dc8","16ec8717-27f7-4847-8742-57fcbfbd75d7"]}
