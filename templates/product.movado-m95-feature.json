The M95 is one of the most charming vintage chronograph movements. Its pushers are inverted, that is to say that the bottom stop\/starts and the top resets. That differentiation means all the cogs that you are used to seeing in a case back are in different places and you’ll often get it wrong out of habit. The calibre was entirely their own, a modular affair designed by Frédéric Piguet. In total, a bewitching and highly unique chronograph that oozes considered taste.<\/p><p><\/p><p>This example has a fantastic case with unusually full lugs.
