We’ve all seen it, but how, why? Think in the watchmaking context. Even if you try to consciously separate the fallacy collectors have to preference the earliest iterations of any watch, it still holds. There’s a magic about tabula rasa thinking, as long as you exclude everything on Kickstarter. And the Fifty Fathoms is what first-principles thinking from some of the brightest Marine Nationale frogmen of the early 50s created. Whether it’s luck or something to do with the creative enthusiasm a new idea attracts, it’s still one of the best looking military divers ever created, 70 years later. I’ve said it before, but it has the kind of persona that’s itching to start a bar fight, and would win.

The Milspec for its very manly name, the ‘No Rad’ for its loud yellow warning. See, the Fifty Fathoms was created in an era where radium was the standard. Then, when it was discovered that your teeth would fall out and you’d die a slow painful death, everyone switched over to tritium. To underscore new safety for military applications, Blancpain printed a massive ‘No Radiations’ marker at 6 in full spectrum color, a rad sign with an X through it. This, I just find amusing, as it’s essentially the brand shouting ‘We won’t kill you guys, promise!’ This one was issued to the Bundeswehr Kampfschwimmers, as serious as frog-manning got at the time. As hazard to life is concerned, I think radiation would be the least of a 60s Kampfschwimmer’s worries. More sharks, bullets, and enough cigarettes to sponsor a Ferrari F1 team.
