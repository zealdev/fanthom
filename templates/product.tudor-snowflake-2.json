This is really the birth of the experimental sibling vibe we love Tudor for today. Interestingly, this reference was available with both a snowcone and snowflake handset at various dates in either black or blue. There are slight dial changes where the ‘m’ and ‘ft’ were bolded but they basically all look similar.
