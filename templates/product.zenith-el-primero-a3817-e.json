It’s a vacuum, but it looks like a nano-gel turbo thruster. This case, with this dial, must’ve made a similar impact in 1971. I mean, I see the reissues today and they look every bit as contemporary and edgy as just about everything except HYT, and these actually work. Moreover, I believe Zenith nailed their chronograph DNA right out of the gate with the El Primero. <\/p><p>It’s every watch designer’s goal to have a beautiful design that doesn’t shout, but is still recognisable from across a room. Three subtle subdial shades; its mission gracefully accomplished. The fact that only the A386 and this have shared this element, and yet almost no one knows what an A3817 is, that’s a shame. There’s even a tiny bit of inter-reference variation, some examples have a monochromatic grey left hand subdial, leading a few to call this A3817 configuration ‘exotic’. Perhaps ‘quadcolor’ would be more accurate. Either nomenclature is not yet well established. <\/p>","add_icons":false,"text_size":"medium","first_button_label":"","first_button_link":"","first_button_outline_style":false,"second_button_label":"","second_button_link":"","second_button_outline_style":true}},"media-with-text-2":{"type":"block","settings":{"large_layout":"image-first","mobile_layout":"text-first","image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/OYSTERDATE_PREC_5.jpg","image_padding":false,"video":"","video_style":"image-play","enable_parallax":false,"text_width":100,"tab_label":"","subheading":"","title":"","text":"<p>Remember back when no one cared or knew what an exotic Tudor was?

We’ve seen that flywheel a hundred times. So far, it’s just Manfred Rossler who did great work around Zenith. There’s more coming. Until, I suspect this is the time start enjoying an A3817.
